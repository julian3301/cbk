    <h2>Why are high labor cost such an issue for landlords?</h2>
    <p>Being unwilling to pay for quality work, landlords tend to look for the cheapest contractors who charge between 30-60$ for labor work. With the drought of skilled labor workers it makes it harder for landlords to find good cheap contractors leading to issues as things tend to need repair over and over.</p>
